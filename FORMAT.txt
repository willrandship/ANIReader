This file lays out the details of the .ANI file format.

#Header

0x0	-	0x400
A 1024-byte, 256-color palette. Some portions of this palette are
modified in-line by the game engine. I haven't mapped which, and
it's probably variable per-game so I won't. Each color takes up
4 bytes, which directly maps to a 32-bit RGBA pixel in the output

0x400	-	0x403
Number of frames in the animation

The rest of the file is in the following format, repeating for
as many frames as specified (shadow frames do not count)

All are now relative to the beginning offset (starting at 0x404)

#Body

0x0	-	0xB
w1,h1,a,b,s1,s2

0xC	-	0x
